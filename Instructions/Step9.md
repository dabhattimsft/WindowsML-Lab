## Step 9: Experiment with other images or EPs

Feel free to experiment with other images. Click the **Browse** button in the top right and there should be an `image2` image you can select, and then you can run the classification again.

Also, feel free to experiment with using the built-in EPs. Click the **CPUExecutionProvider** or the **DmlExecutionProvider** and then click the **Load Model** button (notice that compiling the model isn't necessary for those), and then click **Run Classification**.
